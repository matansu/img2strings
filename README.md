# img2strings
An art project, weaving an image from a continous string. The idea is not mine, but in my opinion my imlementation is currently the state of the art in terms of appearance quality and running time.

## Pytorch optimization
- Pytorch code calculates the optimal strings to recreate the image
- Fast running time: 10-50 seconds, depending on approximation quality (resolution is around 7000x7000 pixels)
- Implemented custom forward and backward layers
- Implemented custom Optimizer
